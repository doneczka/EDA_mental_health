# EDA_mental_health

## **GOAL** - EDA of IT professionals' mental health

- Check what is the scale of the phenomenon
- find any patterns related to mental health.

## **Method and techniques:**

- investigation of the dataset - what kind of features are available, their types, distribution
- cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, outliers)
- visualisation with matplotlib, seaboarn
- SQL for retrieving data from SQLITE database

## **Main conclusions:**

1. Character of the surveys:
- Surveys took place in 2014, 2016, and 2017-2019
- The number of questions changed across the years (surveys weren't equal)
- The number of participants drops year by year

2. Profile of respondents:
- the average age of the respondents is 34, however, there are several tech professionals significantly younger and elder than that
- typical respondent to the survey - male, white, living and working in the US, in a rather big company (more than 100people onboard)
- most of the respondents has an IT-related role in tech-related company.

3. Profile of the mental health employer care:
- some companies provide mental health coverage for employees, but it is not a common practice
- physical and mental health is not always treated equally - physical health is more important in many cases
- companies declare to provide materials about mental health but usually, people don't know where to look for them, so effectively there is no place for employees to look for help

4. Mental health profile of respondents:
- the amount of people who has some family history regarding mental health is significant
- at least 50% of people declare they sought for medical treatment
- the majority of people struggle with some mental health issues
- people believe that their mental state influence their productivity at work

5. Mental health problems across age groups, gender and the size of the company:
- in each of the age groups (except <20) more people reports mental health issues than people who don't suffer from that
- Across gender, the trend is exactly the same (higher number of 'yes'), however, women reports significantly more mental health issues than men (2:1 women/men)
- Size of company doesn't influence the distribution of mental health problems. No matter of the number of people onboard, in more than half of the cases people report some issues. Only small companies have equal distribution.

## **CALL TO ACTION**
If you are an IT manager/team leader/ higher company excecutive - consider applying a mental health support in your company.
